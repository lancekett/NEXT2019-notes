kubernetes is a place to start building a platform, 

buulding blocks
 - knative - 
 - istio
 - kubernetes

anthos hosted control plane, running on GCP

on prem stuff runs on vmware.

optiva

gke on-prem arch

gkectl prepare
gkectl setup

this creates an on-prem "control plane"
gkectl create cluster

register it with GCP
RBAC seems to work

external connectivity works with an internal agent. without need for VPN or interconnect.

still uses helm templates.

not multi-master yet. 

can use the f5 controller for an ingress controller
 - can't use your own load balancer yet, still uses f5.
 - f5 is the front end, still using istio as a service mesh.

stackdriver - works

GLB - in the future? 

harbor - repo for artifacts. 


storage - vsphere cloud provider.  - k8s storage operator?
persistant volume claim - creates persistant storage to create vmdk's to attach to nodes. - 


putting out a blog for git-ops, aka, pipeline for infrastructure. 

networking
each cluster is an island
using bgp for node-to-node communications
calico
more?!?


ensure you have enodun memory / cpu
disable DRS whenusing lots of PV's
deploy monitoring / trending tools
tune metrics and logs
cluster deployment and test automation
enterprise registry solution or GCR
PKI and secret management
cluster access - IAM, ADFS etc. intergration
significant reuse of exising helm chart and ansible scripts

dns and service discovery?
can ci like gitlab pipelines reach into on-prem gke api's?
state?
network storage?
