think big, think global.

region - RTT of <1ms

layer 7 reverse proxies 
 - deployed at the edge 
 - CDN done here

single global IP

routes to the closest zone wirh available capacity

ddos protection
uses stabilized anycast


access to peered vpn from on-prem via VPN???????

---
cloud DNS private zones
---

private zones resoltion for vpn resources

support split horizon
supports stackdriver for private zone queries

net204 - hybrid connectivity.

DNS peering between VPCs

DNS peering - use a project hub, and then DNS peering to the 'spoke' projects. that way the IP can be forwarded and allowed from a single project. 


cardinal health
 - setup 2 host projects. 
  - prod
  - non-prod
 - 100's of service projects
  - service projects are bound to one host project
  - might have 2 projects, one for each region. east / west
  - selected subnets gran 'compute.networks.use' permission to service projects.
 - value of host projects
  - network managers manage a few projects
   - interconnects vpns, vpcs, routers, subnet address management, etc. 
   - centralized appliacnces for internet ingress / egress
   - create new subnets non-disruptively with controlled rollout fto selecto 
  - centralized firewall rule management. (with self-services)
   - service account based firewall rules
   - network tags for pre-approved opt-in patterns
    - (i.e. internal web server, allows 80/443 to internal web serves)
   - cloud functions monitor for aberrant patterns, and enforce compliance. 
 - value
  - accoutnability with fiscal responsibility at service project level
  - devops teams create VM instances and GCP managed services 
  - org policy prohibits service projects from creating anything with an external IP.
