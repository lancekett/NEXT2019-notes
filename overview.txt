 - service projects can use shared VPC from the host project.
 - helps with lots of networking things
  - managed NAT
  - DNS peering with on-prem
  - less overhead of interconnects.
  - centralized firewall rules, with possible pre-defined, pre-approved rules

istio can be run on VM's
 - potentially adding postgres to a "service mesh" with our apps.

High Capacity transfer for on-prem data. 
 - spoke with a Google product manager for storage, and scheduled meeting 2 weeks after NEXT
 - they have a pre-alpha offering around transfering large volumes of data into google cloud storage
 - not really applicable for us at this point in time, but it has potential for long term on-prem -> cloud data transfer.
