anthos 
 - ability to fairly easily run GKE workloads in on-prem environments.
 - uses vmware
 - uses F5 contoller for ingress
 - nginx is being added
 - supports istio
 - "clusters as cattle, not pets"
 - only ubuntu nodes for now

google managed certs 
 - aka, lets encrypt, but google.
 - beta

private google access
 - allows API calls to GCP to route over direct interconnect.
 - will implement this. 

private services access
 - allows managed services like cloud sql / redis clusters to use private internal IP access.

project organization
 - 1 or 2 host projects that manages networking.
 - service projects can use shared VPC from the host project.
 - helps with lots of networking things
  - managed NAT
  - DNS peering with on-prem
  - less overhead of interconnects.
  - centralized firewall rules, with possible pre-defined, pre-approved rules

istio can be run on VM's
 - potentially adding postgres to a "service mesh" with our apps. 
 - agent based.

apigee - hybrid
 - splits apigee's proxy/magic into 2 parts, management plane, and a runtime plane.
  - management plane runs in apigee's GCP.
  - on-prem runtime plane can be deployed on any k8s environment (including GKE on-prem / anthos)
 - provides all the apigee systems and advantages in an on-prem environment.

High Capacity transfer for on-prem data. 
 - spoke with a Google product manager for storage, and scheduled meeting 2 weeks after NEXT
 - they have a pre-alpha offering around transfering large volumes of data into google cloud storage
 - not really applicable for us at this point in time, but it has potential for long term on-prem -> cloud data transfer.
