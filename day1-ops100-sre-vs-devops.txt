devops manifesto
 - reduce organizational silos
 - accept failure as normal
 - implement gradual change
 - levage tooling & automation
 - measure everything

invest in work that will give long term improvements.

"automate this years job away"

SLI vs SLA vs SLO

error budgets

allowable risk dictates slo

when slo is not met, SRE's drop the support back to the developers.

Toil 
 - manual, repetitive, automatable, tactival, devoid of long-term value.


he's going around with a talk called how many 9's of security does your system have
