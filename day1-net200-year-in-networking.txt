2:20pm - a year in networking

private zones
dns forwarding

performance vs cost 
 - premium network goes over Goog's network
 - standard exits google ASAP and goes over the internet
https://www.cedixis.com/google-reports

GGLB - google global load balancing 

load blaancer - deep dive tomorrow
 - support for all ports. 
 - dns based service discovery - 
 - https - user defined request headers, inserts info like client loatation, rtt into header
 - quic http/2 gRPC support

security
 - vpc service controls
  - solves the problem of not knowing what the traffic is. 
  - allow or deny api calls based on the source.
  - api level controls to add the origin of the request as a part of the controls
 - cloud armor
  - mitigates DDOS
  - integrates with global HTTPS load balancer. 
 - cloud nat
  - control outbound access per application
  - can define static addresses for which public IP are used. (outbound whitelisted to partners)
 - google managed certs.
  - beta
  - renewed certs automatically
  - sounds like lets encrypt.
    - yep
  - revoke when LB is deleted.
  - works with gce and gke
 - vpn flow logs
  - metrics 
   - throughput 
   - rtt
  - annotated with 
  - goes to stackdriver and/or bigquery
 - firewall rule logging. 
  - log allow / deny , ingress / egress
  - annotated, VM name + firewall name.
  - logs every connection, not sampled
 - GKE / istio
  - vpn native clusters
  - alias ips for pods and services
  - allows networking for k8s pods over vpn / DI
  - network endpoint group.
   - containers are just another endpoint. 
   - fixes the double hop. 
    - suboptimal load balancing
     - double hop problem, iptables is the 2nd hop from the node to a pod on a different node
  - integration with CDN, IAP, and cloud armor. 
 - istio
  - service mesh
  - mTLS
  - provision to GKE  
   - pilor 
   - mixer 
   - citadel - handles certs

target 
 - partner interconnect. 
 - commerce 
  - 3 projects
   - lab
   - non-prod
   - prod
 - applications need to talk to the platform services, in order to get data from the datacetner. 
  - internet - cdn - application - platform services - data cetners
 - isolation for more 
 - commerce 
  - 56 projects. 
  - segmentation between applications. 
  - cloud armore and ssl policies
  - uses service accounts for soruces and targets for firewall rules
 - vpc service controls
  - draw perimeter arond the projects with similar data classifications, to prevent cross project traffic. 
 - interconnect.
  - vpn - goes over the interenet
   - use vpn for non-commerce
  - partner interconnect for commerce
 - cloud armor
  - target guests -> cdn edge (fastly) -> WAF, routing, logging, cache -> cloud load balancing -> cloud armor -> GCE
  - cloud load balancing - whitelisted for just fastly, hq offices, and data centers
 - firewall logs.
  - export to GCS for forensics
*- restricted internal API's (/30 netblock)

vpc flow logs 
 - how does it work with GKE?
