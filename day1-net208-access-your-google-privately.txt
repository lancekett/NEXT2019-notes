net208 - internal network access
tuesday 5pm 

1) private google access (google infrastructure)
 - GCS, cloud spanner, bigquery
 - google frontend proxy
 - setup
  - advertise a new prefix
   - create network? advertise through bgp?
  - make dns changes
   - 1) confiure your on-prem dns server to resolve *.googleapis.com as a cname to restricted.googleapis.com
   - 2) cloud dns private zone. 

 - "restricted.googleapis.com"

2) managed service with VPC peering
 - https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/private-ip
 - cloud sql, private GKE clusters

by default, static and dynamic routes aren't exchanged with VPC peering
 - there's an import/export flag for these routes to exchange with VPN peers

create a transit VPC?
 - can be used as a "hub" for peering to all other projects. 
 - no bandwith limit
 - vpc peering is free. (but is it really?,) 
  - 

3) private services access (infra built in GCP (redis, netapp, cloud sql, etc))
 - now in GA
 - will have a single "service" VPC?
 - smallest is a /24, they recommend a bigger range, so each service can have a smaller range.
 - option called "private IP" on creation of a managed service. 
  - will create a network within the bigger service VPC range.

 - shared VPC support (host/service projects)
  - only needs to be asked permission for the first service
  - 

4) netapp
 -
