cloud identity session was done yesterday - watch this

"enabling beyondcorp"
 - no trust networks
 - 

partners
 - papercut
 - pfsense
 - jenkins
 - gitlab
 - splunk
 - jamf


adding "client" per app. specify which ou's it can auth / read / etc. or all.. generates a cert, and then turn it on.
then change the client . 
the app will only need a cert to access ldap

SAASPass. - handles SSO and password management

cloud armor = described as an ip blacklist. 

announcing a cloud based GCDS soon.

cloud identity supports managing mobile devices, and desktop support added soon.


questions: 
 - can we extend the schema, and add an attribue for a user? 
 - can you use a system like okta or duo with secure ldap. 
 - can we setup a radius server to point to secure LDAP?
